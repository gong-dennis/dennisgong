This month, I have decided to review recent advances in genetic medicine. I thought this would be fun because the last time I spent time studying this was back in the heyday of CRISPR drug companies ~5 years ago. Today, I'm much more interested in the targets and indications genetic medicine can be used for.

The modality is relatively risky and as a result the biology must be clear and straightfoward. Additionally, because of the high upfront costs and complicated trial and regulatory pathway, there is limited competition within each indication/target. 

For well understood diseases like Duchenne, its an engineering problem. Efficacy should be proportional to exposure and all the bells and whistles related to sequence engineering, delivery vector design, and chemistry are important. Preclinical in vitro assays can have meaningful readthrough to the drug profile in patients.

Finally, the allure of gene therapy is that you could eventually get a curative therapy. They are science experiments prosecuting human genetics evidence. Sometimes they can make money. But they will always teach something meaningful.

#### Infectious Diseases

The idea here is to silence expression of the viral genome. Of course this is only feasible if you can deliver the silencing technology to infected cells. However, hepatitis by name, is a liver inflammation and commonly caused by A, B, C, D, and E viruses. Some hepatitis viruses including B have this cccDNA (covalently closed circular) that persist and enable chronic infection. Targeting these transcripts with siRNA has been an effective strategy.
