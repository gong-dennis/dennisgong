Building transformative companies in biotech is difficult because the costs of failure are high, the timelines are long, and competition for talent is fierce. As a result, companies must learn how to smartly craft stories and narratives to sustain growth through uncertain times. Building narratives is a careful balance of addressing inevitable skeptics while stoking the optimism and hope that lead many to want to build and invest in the life sciences.

Developing a narrative for companies in the life sciences requires a clear story of why the project deserves to function as a commercial entity. Often, this comes in the form of a therapeutic opportunity that is uniquely enabled by the technology or a biological insight, or perhaps meaningful clinical data that was collected as an academic project significantly exceeds benchmarks of commercially available technologies. Unlike traditional venture industries like software or consumer, academia is a meaningful contributor to technological development and progress and very often contains those who are at the bleeding edge of innovation. Many projects deserve to stay in academia where resources and learning are more easily shared and accessible to fellow researchers. Commercializing a technology often comes with this tradeoff of not being able to publish newly invented methods or technologies that enable peers or even the next generation of researchers to replicate and build upon findings. Furthermore, pushing something to become a company that is not yet scientifically mature can even be damaging to a field if the team is unable to execute or there are unforeseen technological issues. Such failures are hallmark contributors to the demise of the aging and longevity field, led by companies like Sirtris, Unity, Elixir who have depleted institutional backing. At the very least, there must be a plausible link between how discoveries in academia have enabled company formation, supported by robust preclinical data.

Following a clear reason for why there is rationale for starting a company, building a narrative often requires showing clear signals for why the project idea is worth the investment of time, energy, and money of starting a company. The strongest signal for public opinion and narrative in biology is what the smartest people are working on. No one will argue that the pace of innovation in biology is slowing down and this rapid, and this rapid pace of progress paired with unprecedented levels of resource and methods sharing has allowed researchers to more fluidly change and choose what they are working on. The backing of seasoned individuals who have a track record of publishing great research, developing medicines, or building transformative technologies can serve as a cornerstone of narrative development especially when it comes to recruiting. Especially for early stage scientists and engineers, one's lineage of the people one has worked under can be important for future roles and success. The backing of prominent researchers thus has a flywheel type effect, building narrative on its own, but also via talented scientists flocking to work with the company.

One of the clearest examples of the signaling strategy has been the resurgence of cell therapy as a therapeutic modality in the 2010s. Star researchers from the NCI had matured the technology for cell therapy from basic research in the early 2000s and had demonstrated proof of concepts in small cohorts of patients. The idea of cell therapy was then somewhat mysterious as prevailing chemotherapies were at the height of oncology, with monoclonal antibodies seen as the next upcoming modality. However, with the management teams of Kite and Juno led by Arie Belldegrun and Hans Bishop respectively, and backed by prominent academics centers, the early cell therapy companies along with their clinical successes have transformed a nascent research field into a dominant therapeutic modality.

The third piece in developing and controlling a long lasting narrative over time is setting clear and balanced expectations. The life sciences industry is built upon public trust and goodwill and it is troubling when narratives are dismissive of limitations and aggrandizing of unproven technology. In the life sciences, there is always someone smarter than you or at least able to connect the dots in literature to replicate a version of what is being built as a company. Each company is an experiment where entrepreneurs take the risk of testing whether the current cutting edge is robust enough to be commercialized. Cycles of narrative skepticism and bullishness are an ongoing discussion with fellow scientists, engineers, and company builders, and answering questions and acknowledging uncertainties is key to keep others concurrently at the bleeding edge on your side. Shifts in sentiment are often made by the many scientists who understand the science being commercialized and are acutely able to separate signal from noise. Taking the pulse on an idea by talking to scientists, engineers, and clinicians is a strong way to correct course and address skepticism if the public narrative has gone awry.

Companies should be able to comment clearly on exactly how their technology enables value creation without allowing their work to become a buzzword. The overuse or misuse of buzzwords attracts skeptics and indicates poor communication with academics and clinicians on the ground who must understand how the technology works in order to evaluate and apply it. One company that operates in a field that is highly inundated with buzzwords but still communicates effective is Dyno Therapeutics, which uses AI to develop improved AAV capsids. Whether it be through top journal publications, conference presentations, or even blog posts on the company news page, Dyno does a strong job of communicating exactly how AI is used to accelerate development and power their platform. Skeptics can be addressed comprehensively, while optimists can continue to imagine new use cases for the technology, and a bullish company narrative is put in place.

Finally, the fourth piece for building a strong company narrative is demonstrating clear and consistent execution. The clinical and technical development processes in the life sciences are notoriously difficult and long, but are necessary in order to ensure that products are safe, accurate, and consistently working as advertised. Setting milestones and hitting them consistently creates a narrative of competent management that understands how to execute and picked the right problem to work on with the right technology to execute with. A proactive media strategy composed of consistent publications, press releases, presentations, and even blog posts keep people engaged and demonstrate that progress is consistently being made. In a scientific landscape where preprints are increasingly accepted as literature, the activation barrier for demonstrating competence is low yet few teams stand out in this regard. In the life sciences, publishing should not end in academia, and continued radio silence from projects is a poor strategy for controlling the narrative around a company.

In therapeutics especially but life sciences more broadly, it has become common for early clinical or even pre-clinical companies to go public, disclose their platform in S-1 filings, and increasingly engage the public and academics with the scientific details of the company. Culturally, sharing has become ingrained in the spirit of life scientists, likely because many hail from academia, but also because patents protect outsiders from competing on the same axes. Beam Therapeutics and Prime Medicine are perhaps held on the highest pedestal of any burgeoning life sciences company, and their core technology is available to any researcher to use at any time. The open source nature of development enables narrative flywheels that continue to expand addressable markets and the supply of scientists who are able to contribute to further technical development. While stealthiness in execution is inevitable (ex. for target selection, key hires, or business development deals), continued public engagement on the technical end with demonstrations of what the technology can do is a strong bellweather for narrative that comes at low cost.

To conclude, four important aspects to control company narratives in the life sciences include 1. having a clear reason to start the company 2. demonstrating signal through hires and backing of prominent people 3. setting clear and balanced expectations, and 4. demonstrating clear and consistent execution through frequent media communications. The foundational companies of tomorrow will be those that communicate well, have strong people as backers, frequently communicate with fellow scientists at meetings and via literature, and don't overpromise on their technology while solving a real and clear problem. Learning from them is simple, but execution is difficult. The most successful teams bridge this gap and come across as mature and competent experiments that we all root for.

** Extra examples **

Examples of strong narrative control:

- [https://arrakistx.com/](https://arrakistx.com/)
- ARCH venture / Flagship Pioneering generally
- a16z generally

Examples of poor narrative control:

- Insilico Medicine
- Orchid Diagnostics
- ARK Invest
- Some aging companies like Sirtris, Unity, Spring Discovery
- Lot of tech-bio stuff or buzzword companies in particular. Any time your company idea becomes a buzzword its possible that was a bad communication job
