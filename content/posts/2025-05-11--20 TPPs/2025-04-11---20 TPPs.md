We've made major progress in treating disease, and over time these nascent indications are evolving into mature ones, saturated with therapies. __Therapeutic whitespace is shrinking fast.__ Where do you go as a drug developer once the low hanging fruit has been picked? Do you hide in academia? 

Chinese CEO scientists are building some of the most fearless new drug companies (see IL-25 in AD, CD3L1 and IGSF8 for cancer immunotherapy, believing in PD-1/VEGF before no one else). While this has seemingly worked beautifully for entrepreneurs in China, there is a fine line between fearless and stupid with high capital costs in the U.S.

Degrade any receptor by conjugating PEI to the antibody [Nature Chem Bio](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-024-01803-1)

One really instructive (for me) exercise was going through lists of proteins that are secreted and detectable in serum. These should be targetable by antibodies and thus are already 'targetable', and are enriched for various hormones, cytokines, and other molecules that have a role in pathology. For example, there are several groups trying to make proteomic signatures of aging
