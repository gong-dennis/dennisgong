Copy Sanofi in Immunology
Copy AZ in oncology

Long half life anything with a pulse
Dual payload ADCs
Biparatopic or bispecific ADCs to enhance internalization
Targeting transcription factors with novel chemistry
Protein removal therapeutics

I'll give reasons for why you might do this or why someone likely hasn't done this yet.

Antibody engineering of Fc regions for ADCs to prevent non-specific internalization

ZED1227, a selective oral transglutaminase 2 inhibitor -> DEGRADER (Characterization of PROTACs for targeting tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2) in cancer)


Degrade any receptor by conjugating PEI to the antibody [Nature Chem Bio](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-024-01803-1)

IL-32 for liver disease

Combine multiple modalities against the same target. E.g. HER2 antibodies and small molecule inhibitors

### Oncology

SPP1 catalytic antibody or some extremely potent format. 

Receptor internalizing antibody for PD-L1

Better FAK inhibitor/degrader

FOSL1 degradation
- Drug resistant cells are dependent on FOSL1

CFLAR degrader
 - Recurrent CRISPR screening hit
 - CB-7587351 

SIK inhibitor for fibrolamellar carcinoma

Trispecific degrader of PI3K and KRAS. 
- KRAS induces cell stasis and requires inhibition of PI3K for apoptosis
- PI3K pathway activation is a resistance mechanism to RAS pathway inhibition

STAT3 degrader

Masked T cell engager

AKT degrader

### Immunology

IgM cleaving enzyme for IgM related disorders such as cold agglutinin disease.
- small market size. 

TGFb for rheumatoid arthritis

Long half life IL-11

Long half life IL1RAP antibody for HS, to compete with IRAK4 inhibitors

Amyloid removal

### Neuroscience

Nav1.8 inhibition in cancer associated pain

SARM1
