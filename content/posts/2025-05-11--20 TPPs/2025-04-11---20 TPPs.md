Copy Sanofi in Immunology
Copy AZ in oncology

Long half life anything with a pulse
Dual payload ADCs
Biparatopic or bispecific ADCs to enhance internalization
Targeting transcription factors with novel chemistry
Protein removal therapeutics

I'll give reasons for why you might do this or why someone likely hasn't done this yet.


### Oncology

Better FAK inhibitor/degrader

FOSL1 degradation
- Drug resistant cells are dependent on FOSL1

CFLAR degrader
 - Recurrent CRISPR screening hit

SIK inhibitor for fibrolamellar carcinoma

Trispecific degrader of PI3K and KRAS. 
- KRAS induces cell stasis and requires inhibition of PI3K for apoptosis
- PI3K pathway activation is a resistance mechanism to RAS pathway inhibition

STAT3 degrader

Masked T cell engager

### Immunology

IgM cleaving enzyme for IgM related disorders such as cold agglutinin disease.
- small market size. 

TGFb for rheumatoid arthritis

Long half life IL-11

Long half life IL1RAP antibody for HS, to compete with IRAK4 inhibitors

Amyloid removal

### Neuroscience

Nav1.8 inhibition in cancer associated pain

SARM1
