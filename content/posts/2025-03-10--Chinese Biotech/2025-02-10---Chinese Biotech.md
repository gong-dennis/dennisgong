The goal today is to review Chiense biotech companies. A lot has been written about the concept of Chinese biotech, speculation on why they are 'winning', how they are licensing so many drugs to U.S. based companies, and general discussion about what it means for U.S. biotech. [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/business/2025/02/16/its-not-just-ai-chinas-medicines-are-surprising-the-world-too), [Wall St. Journal](https://www.wsj.com/health/pharma/the-drug-industry-is-having-its-own-deepseek-moment-68589d70), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/21/business/video/china-biotech-akeso-cancer-drug-ivonescimab-digvid), [Biopharma Dive](https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/biotech-us-china-competition-drug-deals/737543/), [Timmerman Report](https://timmermanreport.com/2025/01/china-is-here-to-stay-as-a-leader-on-the-global-biotech-stage/), and [STAT news](https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/15/jpm-conference-biotech-industry-excited-anxious-chinese-biotech-deals/) all had articles within the past month. Biotech is becoming different than many other industries (e.g. tech) where innovation happens in the U.S., and manufacturing gets outsourced to China. Instead, innovation is getting done in China, and molecules are licensed to the U.S. for clinical trials! 

This all comes in the wake of the [Biosecure Act](https://www.science.org/content/article/bill-targeting-chinese-biotechs-worries-u-s-researchers), which prohibits federal funds from going to five specific Chinese companies â€” BGI, MGI, WuXi Biologics, Wu Xi AppTec, and Complete Genomics â€” beginning in 2032. 

My opinion on why this topic got a lot of press is that people don't really have a great concept of what Chinese people are like and capable of. China is sort of this nebulous entity that is okay to openly criticize and make fun of due to cultural differences. But the fact is that everyone can do science and the U.S. is not the center of the world. It was kind of obvious in retrospect that Chinese biopharma would catch up? Maybe the reason why no one really noticed is that it wasn't worth taking a look at what they were building. I've never actually seen a 'market map' of Chinese biopharma.

I think the most interesting thing to talk about now are the pipelines. I've been curious about what is out there (and what U.S. BD groups are looking at). I want to know what therapeutic areas China cares about, and what new and creative mechanisms they are exploring (its not all me-toos). 

Today I go over 50+ companies, mostly focused on oncology and I&I, with some obesity. I wasn't comprehensive in describing pipelines but just wanted to highlight interesting molecules and overall trends. If you are interested in the [summary](#general-trends), you can skip to the end, but first we will review individual companies. 

Before we begin, the best news feed on Chinese biotech (by far) is from [Minhua Chu](https://x.com/chuminhua432) on Twitter. Highly recommend following. Here is an overview of [Chinese biotech in 2024](https://www.pharmadj.com/en/article/1878614257145294850) from her and her team. Also disclaimer: I did not look at any clinical data. If these drugs are toxic or don't have efficacy I had no idea when I listed them.

# The Companies

![ahshit](ahshit.jpg "ahshit")

Chinese biotech is much bigger than I thought. Company after company -- you think you've reached the end and then you read another Minhua tweet and its another 20 drug pipeline and then you realize that China never ends.

# General Trends

### China is a country of abundance. 
1. Out of 11 DLL3 ADCs under development in the world, 9 are from China.
2. China has [20](https://x.com/JacobPlieth/status/1890007000874107007) approved drugs against PD-(L)1
3. Pipelines are massive. Not only a lot of drugs, but a lot of clinical studies for each drug.
4. It's not just the ease of clinical trials. Even the preclinical pipelines are larger and the timelines between company founding and pipeline expansion are much faster. There may be a lower regulatory bar in China than the U.S. as well. Looking at that 14 patient BCMA CAR-T approval that CARsgen got.

### Every major biopharma company is invested in China
1. AstraZeneca [deal](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/astrazeneca-pays-160m-fibrogens-china-unit-regional-rights-roxadustat) with Fibrogen to buy out China rights to HIF-PH inhibitor roxadustat in Feb 2025. This is on top of AstraZeneca's already large [presence](https://careers.astrazeneca.com/china) in China
2. Pfizer [investment](https://endpts.com/pfizer-to-invest-1b-in-china-over-next-five-years-reports/) of $1bn into China in Nov 2024.
3. Takeda is [setting up](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202501/23/WS67919f86a310a2ab06ea8c4b.html) a China innovation center in Chengdu (Jan 2025).
4. Abbvie, GSK, BMS, Merck, Roche, Takeda, J&J, and Lilly all have licensed assets from Chinese companies. Amgen is perhaps a notable exception, but they have a 20% stake in BeiGene.

### The pharmacology is more complicated

Trispecifics, bispecific ADCs, membrane and soluble target bispecific combinations, multispecific small molecules. Lots of unique strategies.

### Every company can do clinical trials

Maybe a reason why pharma likes to partner (aside from the assets being good and cheap) is that China has tons of human data already, and will continue developing their drugs (getting more clinical data) in China. This is in contrast to U.S. companies, which don't do any clinical development once drugs are licensed out.

### Lot of former American scientists

Lot of former big pharma or former American PhD/postdoc. Pays to be highly technical and able to sprout a new company back home in China with whatever expertise you brought back from the U.S.. Be nice to the seemingly clueless Chinese postdoc in your lab. May be the next leader of a Chinese company licensing you drugs one day.

### Web development expertise needed
Chinese websites need work. Logos suck too. Certainly not paying for marketing.

Landing pages to die for. High Impact (Breakthrough)

# Cool drugs

1. Need to mention PD-1 / VEGF. Ivonescimab developed by Akeso

2. Harbour Biomed had this point that most validated targets in I/O (PD-1/CTLA-4) are part of the B7 family. PD-L1 is B7-H1 and B7-1 is the major ligand mediating CTLA-4 localization. I'm curious how the B7H7 antibody HBM1020 does in trials.

3. Cilta-cel of course 

4. BDCA2 for SLE is a new target I've never heard about. Duality Bio is developing an antibody drug conjugate (BD-2304).

5. PD-1/TGFbR2 fusion protein from Leads Biolabs (LBL-019). Hengrui also has a PD-L1/TGF-b bispecific (SHR-1701) in Ph3.

6. Genrix has a bispecific IL-1 receptor (GR2202) and an IL-15 (GR2301) for vitiligo that I'm interested in. Hengrui also has an IL15 antibody in Ph1 (SHR-1501)

7. Akeso's IL-1RAP antibody

8. I'm interested in Nona Biotech and this Habour Mouse that everyone seems to be using 

9. I just want to follow Systimmune/Biokin's entire portfolio.

10. Mabwell 9MW3811 (IL-11, Ph1) for IPF

11. Highlightll TLL018 is a highly selective dual TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor in Phase 3

12. Shanghai Bao pharma's IgG cleaving enzyme

13. Genfleet's GFS202A a GDF15/IL-6 bispecific antibody

14. Huabo has two interesting drugs: HB0043 a dual IL-17A/IL-36 bispecific, and HB0056 a TSLP/IL-11 antibody in Ph1 for Asthma, AD, IPF, or COPD.

Good job China ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³.
