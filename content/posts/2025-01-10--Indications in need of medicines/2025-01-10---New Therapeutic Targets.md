The goal for today is to develop and apply a pipeline for understanding the landscape of drug targets for a given indication:

### Genetic association: 

Genetic priority score (Duffy et al. 2024): https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-023-01609-2
ML-Genetic priority score (Chen et al. 2024): https://rstudio-connect.hpc.mssm.edu/mlgps/

Plasma proteome association: https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)01268-6

LLM assisted search (for rare disease, drug repurposing): https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03233-x

Functional genomic profiling: [Cancer Dependency Map](https://depmap.org/portal/)

### Clinical trials

NEJM
UpToDate
Clinicaltrials.gov

Pharma projects

### Company filings
They are required to describe competitive landscape

Non-responders to CFTR modulators remain a key challenge.

### Friedreich's Ataxia:

### Severe Hyperlipidemia (e.g., Homozygous FH): 
Need for more effective LDL-lowering strategies.

### Obesity

## Pain and Psychiatry
### Chronic Neuropathic Pain: Lack of effective, non-addictive therapies.

### Treatment-Resistant Depression: 
Patients who fail multiple therapies have limited options.

### Schizophrenia (negative and cognitive symptoms): 
Treatments primarily address positive symptoms.

### Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): 
Few disease-modifying treatments available.

## Pulmonology
### Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF):

### Severe Asthma: 
Biologic treatments don’t address all patient phenotypes.

## Hematology

### Sickle Cell Disease

### Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP): 
Targeted therapies are needed for refractory cases.

### Hemophilia A and B (inhibitor patients): 
New gene therapies remain limited in availability.

### Lysosomal Storage Disorders (e.g., Gaucher, Fabry, Niemann-Pick Disease):
 Limited therapies for severe phenotypes.

### Primary Mitochondrial Diseases: 
Heterogeneous disorders with no disease-modifying treatments.

### Prader-Willi Syndrome: 
Genetic condition with no effective appetite-regulating therapies.
