description: "I analyzed my Spotify data from the last year"
---

I'm a big music listener and I always wondered what my data actually looked like. In this analysis, I looked at my past year's worth of Spotify listening data and built an analysis/visualization script that described my listening history. I found some interesting results and all of the code should be reproducible if you were to download your own data. Hope this is interesting! I've linked the Jupyter export HTML file below.
