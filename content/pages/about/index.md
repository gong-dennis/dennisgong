I'm a PhD Candidate in the Medical Engineering and Medical Physics (MEMP) program, jointly run by Harvard Medical School and MIT. I work in [Will Hwang's lab](https://www.whwanglab.org/) in the MGH Center for Cancer Research and affiliated with the Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard. I grew up in Baltimore, Maryland and did undergrad at Johns Hopkins University where I majored in Biomedical Engineering and Applied Math & Statistics. 

I'm interested in the biology of [therapeutic resistance and recurrence](https://www.dennisgong.com/blog/lab/), and currently I study this in the setting of pancreatic cancer.

My goals are to build biotech companies and make transformative new medicines.
