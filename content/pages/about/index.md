I'm a PhD Candidate in the Medical Engineering and Medical Physics (MEMP) program, jointly run by Harvard Medical School and MIT. I work in [Will Hwang's lab](https://www.whwanglab.org/) in the MGH Center for Cancer Research and affiliated with the Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard. I am particularly interested in questions pertaining to therapeutic resistance to driver oncogene inhibition. Using pancreatic cancer and KRAS addiction as a model system, I hope to understand the biology of resistant and recurrent tumors using a variety of single cell and spatial approaches.

I grew up in Baltimore, Maryland and did undergrad at Johns Hopkins University where I majored in Biomedical Engineering and Applied Math & Statistics.
